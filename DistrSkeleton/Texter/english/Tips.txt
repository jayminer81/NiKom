All text numbers in NiKom are global. This makes it very easy to move
texts between forums if a discussion derails. You then give the command
'!Move <Forum>' in the line editor. (Ctrl-Q, Move <Forum> in the
fullscreen editor). The linking of comments are maintained and you get
to read comments even if they are moved as long as you're a member of the
forum they are moved to.

If you want to you can pause screen output with space, to be able to
do this make sure the flag 'Space as pause' is enabled. You can always
pause the output with Ctrl-S.
You can also select if you want <RETURN> to show now and then. By setting
'Lines:' in your status to 0 these will never show.

All textfiles that you can access with the 'Info'-command can be shortened
to its shortest unique part. Instead of typing 'Info Generallisting' you 
can just type 'inf gen'.

You can define your own profile, it works like the startup-sequence, and is
executed automatically when you log in. In the profile you can have normal
NiKom-commands such as 'list new'. The commands 'Edit Profile', 'Display
Profile' and 'Execute Profile' can be used for this.

You can write a note that is shown whenever someone looks you up with the
'Status' command. You write this with the 'Edit Note' command, and delete
it with 'Delete Note'. If you want this note to show upp whenever someone
writes a mail to you, just enable the flag 'Note ?*by?* mail'.

If you want more information about a command, type 'Manual <command>'. For
example 'Manual List Forums'.

NiKom has a fullscreen editor. To use this you must enable the 'Fullscreen
Editor' flag. There is more info about the fullscreen editor in a separate
info-file.

You can define your own aliases. Instead of typing 'List Files' you can 
create an alias called 'f'. Type 'Manual Alias' for more information.
