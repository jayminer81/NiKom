Hmm, you seem to be having problems. To do things on this BBS you give
commands. These commands can be either one or two words. To display a
list of all usable commands, type 'LIST COMMANDS'.

All commands can be shortened to it's shortest unique part. Instead of
typing 'LIST COMMANDS' you can type 'LI COM'. If what you typed matches
more than one command a list of all possibilities will be shown.

All user names, forum names and flag names can also be shortened. 
Instead of typing 'John Doe' you can just type 'jo do'. It's also possible
to use a users number instead of a users name.

The prompt always has a next command suggested for you, to execute this
command just press <RETURN> without typing anything.

Use the command 'HELP' or '?' to get even more help (both commands do the
same thing)

Type 'PAGE' to page the sysop.
If you don't want to see this text in the future, type 'ENABLE ***'. This
enables the flag "No automatic help". Use the command 'LIST FLAGS' to see
all available flags.
